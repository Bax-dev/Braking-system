Intelligent Braking System with Arduino and Ultrasonic Sensor
Overview
This project implements an intelligent braking system using Arduino, ultrasonic sensors, motor drivers, batteries, and C++ code. The system is designed for a 4-wheel drive chassis, providing automated braking based on real-time proximity detection using ultrasonic sensors.


Features
Proximity Detection: Utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect objects in front of the vehicle.
Real-time Response: Automatically engages braking when obstacles are detected within a configurable range.
Arduino Control: Arduino microcontroller manages sensor data and controls motor drivers for braking.
Modular Design: Compatible with various 4-wheel drive chassis configurations.
Components
Arduino Board: Controls the system logic and sensor data processing.
Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures distance to objects in front of the vehicle.
Motor Driver: Controls the motors for braking actions.
Batteries: Power source for the Arduino and motors.
4-Wheel Drive Chassis: Platform for implementing the braking system.

Usage
Power On:

Ensure batteries are connected and powered on.
Initialization:

The system initializes and calibrates sensors upon startup.
Automatic Braking:

As the vehicle moves forward, the ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles.
If an obstacle is within the specified range, the braking system engages automatically.
Manual Override:

Optionally, implement manual controls for overriding automatic braking.
